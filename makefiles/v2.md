# The V1 Makefile System

---

# A Quick History

- Each repo had a copy paste makefile for their project
- The launch of skynet.v1 in 2016 brought a new requirement that all projects needs to use the tools in the same way
- Supplier compilers were used everywhere

- Each compiler got a custom makefile
  - Common functions went into makecommon
  - targetcommon (inside makecommon) handled all the basic tasks of finding sources and making APLs from parametric data.

---

# Benefits
- Common makefiles via submodules
- Common Code Support
- Very similar interface between compilers
- CI support by default

# Cons

- One size fits all, hard to compile in code of bad quality from suppliers
- Not able to pass different flags to different files
- Custom Makefiles for each compiler meant a long bring up time

... But there was no other choice at the time

# The V2 Makefile System

---

# The V2 Makefile System

- Fast forward a few years and GCC compilers are expected to be used
- Since all the compilers work the same way, the downsides of V1 were starting to get annoying
- Continues the recommended options but also give users the ability to change flags and isolate code in libraries
- Makes the makefile dependent on:
  - The Makefile themselves
  - Flags passed into the makefiles

---

# V2 Structure

- Users submodule a specific compiler tools repo
  - llvm-rl78/kpit-rl78
  - kpit-rx
  - sdcc-stm8
  - gcc-arm-none-eabi
  - gcc (building for the PC)

- Each repo includes the correct tools and extra utilities needed for that micro family

---

# V2 Structure

- Users then create their own frontend makefile and include the following makefiles:
  - `setup.mk`: Included first in the file
    - Includes non-recipe dependencies
      - Variables
      - Functions
      - makecommon
  - `defaults.mk`: Included after the `setup.mk` but before any libraries or source setup
    - The optional defaults for this compiler
  - `worker.mk`: Must be the last file in the frontend makefile
    - Includes all the recipes that build the code from `.c` and `.apl` to `.apl`

---

# Basic Makefile Variables

- `DEFINES`: A GEA specific variable that adds `-D` to the front of any define added to the list.
  - `DEFINES+=TEST=5 FOO=BAR`
- `SRC_FILES`: A list of files to compile.
- `SRC_DIRS`: Searches each folder for sources. Sources are files with an extension that matches the [SRC_EXTENSIONS](https://github.com/geappliances/build-tools.gcc-builder/blob/master/worker.mk#L18C34-L18C34) list.
- `INC_DIRS`: Folders that should be included to compile. `SRC_DIRS` is automatically added to the list.
- `LDLIBS`: Libraries to link in at the final step
- `CFLAGS`: Flags to pass to `gcc`
- `CPPFLAGS`: Flags to pass to the preprocessor
- `CXXFLAGS`: Flags to pass to `g++`
- `LDFLAGS`: Flags to pass to the linker

---

# Libraries

- Are used to isolate code and allow for different compiling options
  - Isolate vender code (suppressing warnings)
  - Make it easier for others to include a block of code

- Libraries use the same variables as before but the are prefixed with the library name
  - `<lib-name>_SRC_FILES`, `<lib-name>_SRC_DIRS`, `<lib-name>_INC_FILES`, etc

- Libraries are typically made using the helper function [create_library_with_defaults](https://github.com/geappliances/applcommon.makecommon/blob/9bee62d1ba7305eacda583f7d01f3816557c2697/v2/targetcommon/builder/setup.mk#L18)
  - This auto imports all the existing flags to the current library
- The labe is going to require you to make a library without the helper function

# GCC Builder

- The [common backend](https://github.com/geappliances/build-tools.gcc-builder) to all the makefiles

- [Included Applcommon Library](https://github.com/geappliances/applcommon.applcommon/blob/master/lib_applcommon.mk)
