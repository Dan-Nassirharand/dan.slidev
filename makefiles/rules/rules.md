# Rules and Recipes

```makefile
target: prerequisites # Rule
	commands # Recipe
```

- Each recipe is run in its own subshell
- When any of the prerequisites change, the target is rebuilt
- Make is whitespace sensitive and `Recipes` are preceded by a `tab` character
- `targets` are generally files that are generated by the `recipes` of that rule

::left::
```makefile
.PHONY: all
all:
	mkdir -p bar
	cd bar
	echo “put into file in bar” >> file.txt
```

::right::

Where will file.txt be placed and why?

<!--
Turning on render whitespace in VS Code by using `ctrl + shift + p` and `View: Toggle Render Whitespace`

Tabs look like a little arrow and it is almost impossible to work on Makefiles without rendering the whitespace.

# Echoing
- Each recipe will is printed on the command line when executed
- Great for debugging, bad for normal use
- Using `@` at the start of a line will suppress the echoing


::left::
```makefile
.PHONY: all
all:
	echo hello
```

```makefile
.PHONY: all
all:
	@echo hello
```

::right::
```bash
$ make
echo hello
hello
```

```bash
$ make
hello
```

Need to mention global silence after variables

# Default Rule

- The first rule in a makefile is the default rule
  - Once a makefile includes other makefiles, this can become complicated
- Specify a target by calling it out directly on the command line
  - `make -f target.mk upload`
- Any target in a makefile is valid, however the most commonly called out targets are...

---

# Phony Targets

- A modifier to a target that tells make that the target is not a real file and should always be executed

```makefile
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	@rm -rf build
```
- If added as a prerequisite to another rule, it will cause that rule to always be rerun, since this dependency is always executed

# Prerequisites

- All prerequisites are run before the recipes of the target can be called

```makefile
target: prereq1 prereq2 prereq3
	<recipe>
```

- Make determines if a prerequisite has changed by the file's timestamp. If the prerequisite timestamp is newer than the target's timestamp, the target must be rebuilt
- When running with jobs, the prerequisites can be run in parallel speeding up the entire process

<!--
Don't forget that phony targets are always marked as needing to be rebuilt

When making the prerequisites its important to think about what a target is truly dependent on. Putting extra or unneeded prerequisites can make the job take extra time that wastes everyone's time.

# Folder Timestamps

Consider this makefile:

```makefile
build/test.o: build
	touch build/test.o

build:
	mkdir -p build
```

On the first run, everything is created as normal
```bash
$ make
mkdir -p build
touch build/test.o
```

Running it again gives:

```bash
$ make
make: 'build/test.o' is up to date.
```

All is good!

---

# Folder Timestamps

Adding another file to this folder and re-running make makes `test.o` rebuild?
```bash
$ touch build/file.txt
$ make
touch build/test.o
```

This is because a folder's timestamp is updated whenever a file inside of it is edited.

```bash
$ make
mkdir -p build
touch build/test.o
$ ls -l
drwxrwxr-x   2 beeler beeler  4096 Oct 11 16:21 build
$ touch build/file.txt
$ ls -l
drwxrwxr-x   2 beeler beeler  4096 Oct 11 16:23 build
```

This could cause a long process to rebuild for no reason!

# Order-Only Prerequisites

Prerequisites that are built before the target but do not force the target to rebuild if updated.

```makefile
target: prerequisites | order-only prerequisites
```

Using this knowledge we can fix our makefile by making the folder an order-only prerequisite:

::left::
```makefile
build/test.o: | build
	touch build/test.o

build:
	mkdir -p build
```

::right::
```bash
$ make
mkdir -p build
touch build/test.o
$ touch build/file.txt
$ make
make: 'build/test.o' is up to date.
```

<!--
We use this for tool setup too.

# Multiple Targets

- Rules can have multiple targets!
- The target is run multiple times, it does not indicate that a rule makes two files at the same time

::left::
```makefile
.PHONY: all
all: foo bar
	@echo done

.PHONY: foo bar
foo bar:
	@echo $@
```

::right::
```bash
$ make
foo
bar
done
```
