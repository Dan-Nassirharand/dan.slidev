# Database

<div>
  "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system." - <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>
</div>
<br>

- Storage
- Access
- Retreival

<br>

- Tables (a.k.a. Relations)
  - Relational Schema
  - Attribute
  - Record

# Relational Schema

<div>
  "A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database" - <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/database-schema" target="_blank">IBM</a>
</div>
<br><br>

- Acts as the blueprint for your database
  - What does it look like?
  - What type of data is stored?

# Relational Algebra
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/introduction-of-relational-algebra-in-dbms/

The main purpose of relational algebra is to define operators that transform one or more input relations to an output relation. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

## Operations
- Selection (σ)
- Projection (π)
- Union (U)
- Set Difference (-)
- Natural Join (⋈)
- More ...

# SQL

<div>
SQL is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
</div>
<br><br>

- Defines a standard that is implemented by a DBMS
  - An implementation will differ from one DBMS to another
  - Most do not fully adhere to the standard

# Database Management System (DBMS)

<div>
  "A DBMS is a system that allows users to create, modify, and query databases while ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data access." - <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/introduction-of-dbms-database-management-system-set-1/" target="_blank">GFG</a>
</div>
<br><br>

- Data Modeling
- Data Storage and Retrieval
- Concurrency Control
- Data Integrity and Security
- Backup and Recovery
